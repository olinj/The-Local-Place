    </p>

    <h3>The Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Our Candle Making Workshop at Made @ The Local Pottery and Candle Studio is a comprehensive, hands-on education in professional candle-making techniques. Rather than simply pouring wax, you'll learn the science and art behind creating beautiful, high-quality candles that actually burn properly, smell amazing, and look store-quality. Our expert instructors guide you through every step: selecting the right wax type (we use premium soy wax because it burns cleaner and holds fragrance better than paraffin), understanding fragrance oil chemistry and proper concentration levels (too much scent makes candles burn poorly; too little and they lack aroma), mastering temperature control (this is critical—improper temperatures cause poor adhesion, frosting, and burning issues), blending complementary fragrances to create signature scents, and applying professional finishing techniques. You'll work with premium soy wax, carefully selected fragrance oils from top manufacturers, and quality containers that enhance your finished product. By the end of your workshop, you'll understand not just how to make candles, but why each step matters—knowledge you can take home and use to refine your craft.
