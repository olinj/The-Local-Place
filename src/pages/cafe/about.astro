      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We're a locally owned cafe on the square in Centerville. We serve coffee that doesn't taste burnt. Food that's made fresh, not reheated. Ice cream that's creamy and rich. We're here six days a week, opening at 6am because we know people need caffeine before the world does.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't a corporate coffee shop. It's not a franchise. It's a place run by people who actually care whether your latte tastes good, whether your breakfast sandwich is hot, whether you leave satisfied.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <div class="values-grid">
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Quality Over Speed</h3>
          <p>We could rush through orders and serve more people. We don't. Every espresso shot is pulled fresh. Every sandwich is made to order. You wait a little longer, but it's worth it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Real Ingredients</h3>
          <p>House-made pastries. Homemade ice cream. Fresh vegetables. Real vanilla. We don't cut corners because we don't want to eat corner-cutting food—and neither do you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Community Matters</h3>
          <p>We're not just selling coffee and food. We're creating a space where people actually want to spend time. Comfortable seating, good Wi-Fi, friendly faces. Come for the latte, stay for the vibe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>Your Tuesday morning latte should taste like your Friday afternoon one. We train our staff. We stick to recipes. We care about getting it right every time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The Local Place started because Centerville needed a real cafe. Not a gas station coffee counter. Not a chain with stale pastries. A place where you could get a properly pulled espresso, a fresh-made breakfast sandwich, and a scoop of ice cream that tastes like someone's grandma made it—if that grandma was a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        We opened on the square at 111 South Public Square. We bought an espresso machine that actually works. We started baking pastries fresh every morning. We made ice cream in-house. We opened at 6am because people told us they needed coffee that early.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we're the place where locals get their morning coffee, where families grab lunch, where people stop for ice cream on a random Tuesday. We're part of the routine. We're the local place.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Offer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Specialty Coffee:</strong> Espresso drinks, lattes, cappuccinos, cold brew—pulled fresh, not rushed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Pastries:</strong> Baked in-house daily. Croissants, muffins, scones, cinnamon rolls.</li>
        <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Sandwiches, bagels, breakfast plates. Made to order, open at 6am weekdays.</li>
        <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Paninis, wraps, salads, soups. Fresh ingredients, hot off the press.</li>
        <li><strong>Homemade Ice Cream:</strong> Creamy, rich, rotating flavors. Made here, not trucked in.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoothies & Beverages:</strong> Real fruit smoothies, iced drinks, specialty beverages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
      <p>
        Because you can taste the difference. Because your coffee isn't bitter. Because your pastry is flaky and warm. Because your lunch is made to order. Because the ice cream is better than any chain. Because we actually care.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have options. You could drive to a chain. You could settle for gas station coffee. But you don't, because this place is better. And we work every day to keep it that way.
