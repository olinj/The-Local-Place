    <h2>Ceramic Painting Workshop - Centerville, TN</h2>
    <p>Our Ceramic Painting Workshop at Made @ The Local Pottery and Candle Studio offers a structured, hands-on learning experience for anyone interested in developing their ceramic painting skills. Unlike casual pottery painting sessions, our workshop focuses on teaching proper techniques, color theory, and professional-grade methods that produce gallery-quality results.</p>

    <h3>The Experience</h3>
    <p>In this comprehensive workshop, you'll learn the foundational skills that separate amateur pottery painters from true artisans. Our instructors guide you through color theory and how complementary colors create visual impact on ceramic pieces. You'll learn brush techniques for clean lines, smooth gradients, and detailed designs. We cover surface preparation, paint consistency, layering techniques, and special effects like glazing and antiquing. You'll practice on multiple pre-made ceramic pieces, with plenty of guidance and feedback. By the end of the session, you'll have not only created beautiful pieces but also gained skills you can refine for years to come.</p>
