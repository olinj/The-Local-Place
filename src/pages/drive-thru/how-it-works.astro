      <h2>The Drive-Thru Experience</h2>
      <p>
        You don't want to get out of your car. Your kids are in the backseat. It's raining. You're running late. Whatever your situation, we get it. That's why we're here. No parking hassles. No going inside. No waiting around. Just pull up, order (or pick up your pre-order), and go.

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <h3>Order Ahead (Optional, But Smart)</h3>
          <p>
            Pull out your phone. Open Clover. Browse our menu. Customize your order however you want it. Hit submit. Boom. Done. Your order goes straight to the kitchen and we start making it immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            <strong>Why do this?</strong> You pull up and your coffee's ready. No wait. No "five more minutes." It's there.

          <h3>Drive Up to the Window</h3>
          <p>
            Head to 1171 TN-100 in Centerville. Pull around to the drive-thru window. No need to find a parking spot. No need to navigate through a building. Just roll up.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            <strong>Timing:</strong> If you ordered ahead, time it so you arrive 5-10 minutes after ordering. If you're ordering when you arrive, we'll have your food ready in about 3-5 minutes.

          <h3>Tell Us Your Order (Or We Hand It Over)</h3>
          <p>
            Already ordered on Clover? Just tell us your name. We'll hand you your order through the window. Haven't ordered yet? Tell us what you want and we'll get it ready for you right now.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you didn't order ahead and it's busy, don't worry. We're fast. Our limited menu means we know exactly what we're doing.

          <h3>Pay & Go</h3>
          <p>
            Hand us your card or cash. We process it right there at the window. Take your coffee, breakfast, or lunch. Stay in your car the whole time.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            <strong>No surprises:</strong> Prices on Clover match prices at the window. What you see is what you pay.

          <div class="step-number">5</div>
          <h3>Hit the Road</h3>
          <p>
            You've got your coffee. You've got your breakfast. You're already back in your car. Drive to work. Sit in your driveway. Go to the next thing. You're done here.
          </p>
          <p class="step-detail">
            <strong>That's it.</strong> No parking lot time. No going inside. In and out in minutes.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can still order at the window. Just pull up and tell us what you want. We'll have it ready in 3-5 minutes. It's that simple.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You'll pick up in about 5-10 minutes after you order. If you order ahead and come right away, it might be 2-3 minutes. We start making orders immediately when they come through.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you've just ordered, call us at (931) 729-4821 right away and we might be able to adjust it. Once we've started making it, changes are tougher. Best practice: double-check before you submit.</p>

            <p>Morning (7-8:30am) and lunch (12-1pm) are our busiest. If you're coming during those times, ordering ahead guarantees your order's ready and waiting. Other times, walkin orders are lightning fast.</p>

            <p>Absolutely. On Clover, you can add as many items as you want to one order. Just give us names at the window if there are multiple people in the car, or put special instructions on your order.</p>
