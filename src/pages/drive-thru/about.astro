      <h2>Why We Started</h2>
      <p>
        The Local Place Cafe is amazing. Real espresso. Fresh pastries. Homemade ice cream. People drive 40+ minutes to get there. But we realized something: not everyone has time to go inside, sit down, and linger. Some people want their coffee in under 3 minutes. Some people have kids in the backseat. Some people are running late. Some people just don't want to get out of the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we built a drive-thru. Not a separate operation. Not a different quality standard. The same people pulling espresso shots. The same fresh pastries. Same everything, just without the "get out of your car" part. You get quality. You get speed. You get convenience. Pick the car, you don't have to choose.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <div class="philosophy-grid">
        <div class="philosophy-item">
          <h3>Quality Never Takes a Backseat</h3>
          <p>
            Drive-thru doesn't mean fast food. Our baristas care about every shot. Our pastries are fresh. Our sandwiches are made to order. Being quick doesn't mean cutting corners.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-item">
          <h3>We Respect Your Time</h3>
          <p>
            You've got places to be. Order ahead on Clover, and your coffee's ready in 5 minutes. No waiting in line inside. No "five more minutes." Just efficient, no-nonsense service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-item">
          <h3>Limited Menu, Maximum Execution</h3>
          <p>
            We don't do everything. We do a few things really well. Coffee drinks. Breakfast sandwiches. Pastries. Lunch items. Each thing is done right because we're focused on doing it perfectly, not covering 200 menu items.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-item">
          <h3>Convenience is the Point</h3>
          <p>
            You shouldn't have to feel bad about not wanting to come inside. Your order matters whether you pick it up in a car or sit at a table. We designed this for your reality, not some idealized "customer" who has unlimited time.

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <div class="comparison-grid">
        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>🚗 For the Commuter</h3>
          <p>
            We open at 5am because we know you're leaving early. Order your coffee on Clover before you head out. Roll up and grab it. Fresh espresso in your hand before you hit the highway.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 For Parents</h3>
          <p>
            Kids in the backseat, it's raining, you don't want to drag everyone inside. We get it. Pull up, order, stay in the car. Nobody has to get unbuckled. Nobody has to wait inside. Everyone's happy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>🏃 For the Busy Professional</h3>
          <p>
            Lunch break is 30 minutes. You need to eat, not spend 15 minutes getting food. Our limited menu means no decision paralysis. Order online, pick it up, eat at your desk or in your car.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>☕ For the Coffee Snob</h3>
          <p>
            You want espresso that tastes like someone actually cared. You've got no time for the cafe experience. Drive-thru espresso is just as good. Better, actually, because it's faster and you weren't expecting to wait.

      <h2>The Same People You Trust</h2>
      <p>
        The baristas at our drive-thru? They're the same ones making espresso at The Local Place Cafe. They care about how your latte tastes. They know how to steam milk properly. They remember your order if you come in regularly. The difference is just that now they're making it in a drive-thru window instead of inside. The quality's the same. The care's the same. Just faster.
