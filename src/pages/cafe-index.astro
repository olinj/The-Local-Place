        <p class="intro-lead">
          The Local Place Cafe isn't trying to be fancy. We're a community cafe on Centerville's public square serving fresh coffee, house-made pastries, hot breakfast, real lunch, and homemade ice cream. We open at 6am so you can grab coffee before work, stay open until 6pm so you can wind down with dessert, and treat everyone like neighbors—because that's what you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our specialty coffee is fresh-pulled, not burnt. Our pastries are baked here, not trucked in frozen. Our ice cream is made in-house with rotating flavors. Everything is made with care because we're not just serving food—we're feeding our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a Centerville local grabbing your morning latte, a Nashville visitor discovering us for the first time, or a Franklin family making the drive for our homemade ice cream, you're welcome here. Come for the coffee. Stay for the conversation. Leave feeling like you found something real.
